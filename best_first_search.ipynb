    "#### My motivation to use this heuristic\n",
    "- I needed a value for each of the zones to be able to calculate the heuristics of each station. However, it is really difficult to assign a value to the goal station each time we generate a neighbor. So, it was efficient to assign each zone a fixed value. This value has no other purpose than helping in calculating the heuristic.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- The values can be taken as [1, 2, 3, …, 10] or [20, 40, …, 200]. However, my preferred way was to consider [10, 20, …, 100]. Once I had this setup, getting the heuristic was just calculating the absolute difference between the goal zone and the neighbor’s zone. The algorithm will sort the BFS_list as per the lowest heuristic in it so that the lowest heuristic station is at the start of the list, which will be popped next. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Now, there are 2 exceptions while calculating the absolute difference between the goal zone and the neighbor’s zone. It can happen that the zones of the neighbor and the goal are same but the neighbor station is not the goal station. In this case, I’m returning the value 1 by default which will be the lowest heuristic value in the list and this node will be popped from the list next to generate its neighbors. \n",
    "\n",
    "- If the neighbor and the goal are same, I’m by default returning the heuristic as 0 as we have reached the goal node and then terminate the loop. "
